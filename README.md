This is a repo used to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.

Merge conflicts are a very common but not so common part of working with GitHub. Do not fear the conflicts, my friends!

Trying to make conflict myself to this repo example of conflict excersise for the GitHub conflict repo case.
